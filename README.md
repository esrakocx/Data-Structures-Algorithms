## www.patika.dev Data Structures and Algorithms Project

### [22,27,16,2,18,6]

### _1- Write the stages of the above given sequence according to the sort type:_


[22,27,16,2,18,6]

[16,22,27,2,18,6]

[2,16,22,27,18,6]

[2,16,18,22,27,6]

[2,6,16,18,22,27] --> **Done**!



### **_2- Insertion Sort: Big-O Notation_**

_Best Case Time Complexity_ -> **O(n)**

_Average Case Time Complexity_ -> **O(n^2)**

_Worst Case Time Complexity_ -> **O(n^2)**


**The number 18 is covered by the average case.**




### _3- Write the first 4 steps of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15.6] according to Insertion Sort:_

[3,7,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[3,5,7,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[2,3,5,7,8,9,4,15,6]

[2,3,4,5,7,8,9,15,6]

[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,15] --> Done!


# Merge Sort

### [16,21,11,8,12,22]
### _1- Write the stages of the above given sequence according to the merge sort type._

[16,21,11]       |      [8,12,22]
    
[16,21] [11]     |      [8,12] [22]

[16] [21] [11]   |      [8] [12] [22]

[16,21] [11]     |      [8,12] [22]

[11,16,21]       |      [8,12,22]


### **[8,11,12,16,21,22]**


### **_2- Merge Sort: Big-O Notation_**

_Best Case Time Complexity_ -> **O(nlog(n))**

_Average Case Time Complexity_ -> **O(nlog(n))**

_Worst Case Time Complexity_ -> **O(nlogn(n))**



# Binary Search Tree

### [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2]
